# EDA-WITH-PYTHON

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aimed at uncovering insights, patterns, and relationships within the dataset. EDA is a crucial step in any data science project as it helps to understand the data's structure, detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and summarize main characteristics.

Project Objectives

Perform a detailed analysis of the dataset

Identify trends and correlations

Visualize the data for better understanding

Highlight potential areas for further analysis or feature engineering

Tools & Libraries Used

Python: Main programming language used for the analysis

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: For numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization

Scikit-learn: For basic data preprocessing and correlation analysis

Key Steps in the EDA

Data Collection: Loading the dataset and initial inspection.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.

Descriptive Statistics: Generating summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.

Data Visualization:

Histograms and density plots to check the distribution of variables

Boxplots to identify outliers

Heatmaps and pair plots to visualize relationships between features

Correlation Analysis: Checking for linear relationships between numerical features.

Insights & Findings: Summarizing key observations and actionable insights.

Results & Insights

Notable trends and distributions were highlighted (e.g., highly correlated features).

Potential outliers were identified and their impact was assessed.

Key variables contributing to the target feature were discussed.
